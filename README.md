# Will it build blog dataset

This repo has been replaced by the willit cli command https://github.com/gatsbyjs/will-it-generate
It still exists here because the Drupal, Contentful, and WordPress benchmarks used this data to import. 
Keeping it here incase we need to re-import at some point and want the same data is a good idea.
